  <h2 class="text-center nina pad-t">About Me</h2>

  <p>My name is Emma and I’m a graphic designer born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. As is typical with the creatively-inclined, I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember. My hobbies include doodling, reading, playing musical instruments and watching shameful amounts of TV and movies (all four have been known to happen at once).</p>
  <p>I am currently a third-year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. Come April 2018, I’ll be an Algonquin College graduate (provided the winter semester remains catastrophe-free)!</p>
