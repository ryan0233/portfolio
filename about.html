  <h2 class="text-center nina pad-t">About Me</h2>

  <p>My name is Emma and I’m a graphic designer born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. As is typical with the creatively-inclined, I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember. My hobbies include doodling, reading, playing musical instruments and watching shameful amounts of TV and movies (all four have been known to happen at once).</p>
