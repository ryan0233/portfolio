    <p>The goal for this project was to design the layout of a fictional magazine named CanScience. I had to design the 20-page magazine within the constraints of adhering to a baseline grid, page size and 2-column layout. It also required a lot of time-consuming attention to detail, as it was necessary to find all the errors in the provided text â€” typographical or otherwise.</p>
